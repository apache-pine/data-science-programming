# GitHub Setup With Resume
__Course CSE 250__
__Kylar Sorensen__

## Elevator pitch

I finished setting up my GitHub account and learned a lot more about GitHub and Git. I learned how to use Git and VS Code in conjunction with Git and GitHub. Successfully cloned the resume remplate and personalized the resume. This was forked to the BYU-I Resumes organization and forked by a peer who reviewed and suggested changes to my resume. These changes were accepted and the suggested changes were made. My resume doesn't currently hold a lot of information as I have not done much in this industry yet, but I learned a lot about using GitHub, Git, VS Code and how to build a successful and professional resume.

### GRAND QUESTION 3
#### Push your results to GitHub and have another student fork your repository to make edits.

After completing the edits and pushing those to GitHub from VS Code, I posted the link to Slack and requested a peer review. I peer reviewed another student's resume while they reviewed mine.

### GRAND QUESTION 4
#### Accept the proposed changes from the student review and finish your final version.

The proposed changes from Jeffrey Smith were accepted. I then had to go back to VS Code and make the other changes that were suggessted, but Jeffrey didn't have the knowledge to fill in the information on his own. After these last few changes were made and pushed to GitHub, my resume was complete.
